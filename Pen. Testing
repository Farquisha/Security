Penetration testing - trying to get into a machine to measure how secure it is.

Phase 1:
    Define mission goals and targets
    Determine scope of mission
    Define RoE

Phase 2: Recon
    Information gathering about the target through the public sources

Phase 3: Footprinting
    Accumulate data through scanning and/or interaction with the target/target resources

Phase 4: Exploitation and initial access
    Gain an initial foothold on network

Phase 5: Post-Exploitation
    Establish Persistance
    Escalate privileges
    Cover your tracks
    Exfiltrate target data

Phase 6: Document Mission
    Document and report mission details
